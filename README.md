### Homework 6
###  I implemented the Bet More game with an extended rule. Player 2 has an initial balance of 100 coins and can bet on their number. 
### If player 2 wins, they get full bet. 
### If they lose, they lose all the bet.
###  If it's a draw, they get half of the bet.

### *** Some notices
#### The method pickcard() should actually be named start()
#### When a Player object is created the game is automatically started (in constructor) so there's no need to extra call the start method.
